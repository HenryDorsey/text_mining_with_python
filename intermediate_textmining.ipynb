    "N-grams are combinations of multiple words as they appear in the text. The N refers to the number of words captured in the list. N-grams with N=1 are referred unigrams and are just a nested list of all the words in the text. Following a similar pattern, bigrams (N=2), trigrams (N=3), etc. can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "N-grams allow you to capture the structure of the text which can be very useful. For instance, counting the number of bigrams where \"said\" was preceded by \"he\" vs \"she\" could give you an idea of the gender breakdown of speakers in a text. However, if you make your N-grams too long, you lose the ability to make comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another concern, especially in very large data sets, is that the memory storage of N-grams scales with N (bigrams are twice as large as unigrams, for example) and the time to process the N-grams can balloon dramatically as well.\n",

    "This is significantly more advanced than the rest of the tutorial. This takes the TF-IDF matrix and applies a [k-means clustering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). This groups the texts into clusters of similar terms from the TF-IDF matrix. This algorithm randomly seeds X \"means\", the values are then clustered into the nearest mean. The centroid of the values in each cluster then becomes the new mean and the process repeats until a convergence is reached."
